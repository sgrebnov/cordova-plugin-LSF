Implements Lamp discovery and controlling lamp preferences (Hue, Saturation, Color Temperature, Brightness) using AllJoyn Lighting  protocol.

## AllJoyn Connected Lighting Project
Apache Cordova plugin to develop AllJoyn LSF-compatible mobile applications.

The Connected Lighting Project develops the Lighting Service Framework (LSF) providing an open and common way of communicating with AllJoyn-based connected lighting products, regardless of manufacturer. This will enable lighting manufacturers to make their products interoperable with each other as well as other connected things, and provide 3rd party application developers with a common interface (API) to communicate with lights across manufacturers.
